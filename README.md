# Constructor_word_guess
Hangman style, command line game make with object constructors.

This game is comprised mainly of two constructors; letter and word. Each letter is an object and each word object has an array of letter objects. There are methods included for comparing the input to each letter, returning a string of letters and underscores appropriately, building the objects from a string, etc.

Just 
```
npm install
```
and run node hangman.js to play!
